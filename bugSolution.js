//Possible causes and solutions
/* 1. Conflicting styles: Ensure there are no conflicting styles from other CSS files or global styles that could override Tailwind classes.
2. Plugin incompatibility: Check for issues with Tailwind plugins; update or disable them to identify problems
3. Incorrect configuration: Verify the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly configured and includes all necessary plugins and content paths.
4. CSS specificity: If using custom CSS, make sure the specificity of your styles doesn't inadvertently override the Tailwind classes. Use !important with caution.
5. Missing or incorrect purge:  In production, make sure that `purge` is correctly configured in `tailwind.config.js` to remove unused styles, as unused classes could cause unexpected behavior.*/
